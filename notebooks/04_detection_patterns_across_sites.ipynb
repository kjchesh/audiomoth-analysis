However, when normalised by the number of active recording devices, a clear increase in detections per device was observed from late February into late March, peaking in weeks 13–14. This pattern is consistent with increased vocal activity during the spring breeding period. Weeks 10, 11, and 15 likely represent partial recording periods due to reduced device availability, most likely resulting from battery drop-outs."
