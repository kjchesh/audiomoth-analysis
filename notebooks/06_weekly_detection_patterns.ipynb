    "Weekly detection totals varied substantially across the study period. However, when normalised by the number of active recording devices, a clear increase in detections per device was observed from late February into late March, peaking in weeks 13–14. This pattern is consistent with increased vocal activity during the spring breeding period. Weeks 10, 11, and 15 likely represent partial recording periods due to reduced device availability, most likely resulting from battery drop-outs."

    "Weekly detection patterns vary between sites but show broadly similar temporal trends when adjusted for the number of active devices. Normalising detections by the number of devices recording each week reduces bias introduced by differences in deployment size and periods of device downtime, allowing more meaningful comparison between sites.\n",

    "Despite this adjustment, variation in detection levels persists, reflecting differences in local habitat, calling intensity, and temporal availability of recording effort. It should be noted that this approach accounts for whether devices were active during a given week, but does not capture partial-week downtime or variation in daily recording effort, which may still influence weekly detection rates."
