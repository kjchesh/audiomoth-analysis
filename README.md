## AudioMoth Data Analysis

This project explores and analyses bird detections from AudioMoth deployments using BirdNET-style outputs. The focus is on understanding site-level patterns and assessing detection confidence as groundwork for future analysis or modelling.

### Currently includes

- Python utilities for loading, cleaning, and validating detection data

- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis of:

- species richness and activity across sites

- dominant species patterns

- detection confidence across sites and species

This work is exploratory and intended to establish data quality and assumptions.
